This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where a route handler fetches user data based on a user ID from the request parameters.  However, it lacks error handling for cases where the provided user ID is invalid. This can lead to database errors, unexpected application crashes, or vulnerabilities. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
